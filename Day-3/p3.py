"""
Get Binary Number -

-------512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2,1

Binary of 5 is - 0101
Binary of 3 is - 0011

Real Life Appications -->

1. Data Compression & Storage Optimization
Use: Bitwise operations help reduce memory usage by manipulating bits directly.

2. Image Processing
Use: Manipulate pixel values or apply masks using bitwise operations.

3. Cryptography & Security
Use: Simple encryption techniques like XOR cipher use bitwise operations.

4. Networking (IP & Subnet Masks)
Use: Bitwise operations are used to calculate network addresses and subnetting.

5. Performance Optimization (Math & Game Dev)
Use: Replace multiplication/division with shifts to optimize performance.

Flags and Permissions (Access Control Systems)
Imagine managing user permissions like:

Write = 2
Execute = 4

#Example: Assign and check user access
# User has Read + Execute
user_permission = 1 | 4  # 5

# Check if user has Write access
has_write = user_permission & 2
print("Write access?", bool(has_write))  # False

# Add Write access

#  5. Escape Sequence – Handling special characters
"""
Escape sequences are special characters preceded by a backslash (\) used to represent 
things that are difficult to type directly in a string, like new lines, tabs, quotes, or 
Unicode characters.
"""
# 1. New line – splits output into two lines
print("Hello\nWorld")

# 2. Tab space – creates horizontal spacing
print("Name:\tShalini")

# 3. Double quote inside string
print("She said, \"I love Python\"")

# 4. Single quote inside string
print('It\'s a sunny day')

# 5. Backslash in file path
print("C:\\Users\\Shalini\\Documents")
